# makersbnb

Our first makers academy group project to create a version of AirBnB.

The Group:
- [Oliver Pople](https://github.com/oliverpople)
- [Alex Scott-Tonge](https://github.com/alexscotttonge)
- [Tom Spencer](https://github.com/TomSpencerLondon)
- [Olivia Beresford](https://github.com/oliviaberesford)

our main objective is to build this project using languages, test frameworks and a database we haven't used before to further our learning.

## Given Specifications:

- Any signed-up user can list a new space.
- Users can list multiple spaces.
- Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
- Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
- Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
